## Chicagoland Local Legislatures

### About
This is the beginnings of data collection on city councils and village trustees in the Chicagoland area. The data are maintained by me. You can more about my research [here](https://www.cgoodman.com).

### Variable Notes
* **Incorporation Date** - Many municipalities in Illinois have at least two (if not three) dates of incorporation. The one displayed in the files here is the official date of incorporation according to the Secretary of State's office.
